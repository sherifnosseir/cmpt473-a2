;;this namespace provides expresso rule-based translator facility. Most notable
;;are the rule macro, which constructs a rule and apply-rule wich applies a
;;rule in a core.logic context.

;;A rule consists of a 3-element vector with [pattern transformation guard]
;;The elements of the vector can contain fresh lvars
;;the rule macro converts ?-starting symbols to fresh lvars
;;The transition can be a normal lvar-containing expression like the pattern
;;or can be a core.logic relation
;;the guard is optional (succeed is used if no guard is supplied)
